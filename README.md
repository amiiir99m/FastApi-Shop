FastApi Online Shop project
What's happening: 
  Admin:
    add product (you can add several images to you product)
    update prodct
    delete product
    every detail about carts, users, and etc.
  User:
    Add product to cart
    Read, update, remove cart (his own cart)
    see all products
  Observer:
    Can see all products (by title, by category, all, etc)  
    
  I used PostgreSQL and alembic to manage migrations
  
  Notice: don't run this on production. You need to change secret key in settings.py file and etc for your own purposes.
